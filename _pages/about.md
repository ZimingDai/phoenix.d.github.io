👋 Hi there! I'm **Ziming Dai (戴子明)**, a second-year Master's student in the College of Intelligence and Computing at **Tianjin University** 🇨🇳. I currently conduct research at the [Edge Big Bang Lab](http://www.drxiaofei.wang/), under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaofei Wang](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wangxiaofei/index.html) and [Prof. Chao Qiu](http://qiuchao.fei8s.com/).

🎓 I received my **Bachelor of Engineering** in **Artificial Intelligence** from **Tianjin University** in **2019–2023**, where my undergraduate thesis on *blockchain-based group federated learning* was awarded as an **Outstanding Graduation Thesis**. Currently, I am pursuing my **Master of Engineering** in **Electronic and Information Engineering** at the same institution, expected to graduate in **2026**.

💼 In the summer of 2022, I interned as an **Algorithm Engineer** at **Beijing Wenge Technology Co., Ltd.**, where I led a team focused on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in low-resource languages, coordinating efforts across model pretraining and linguistic enhancement modules.

💡 My research centers on **federated learning**, **edge intelligence**, and **large language model (LLM) personalization**. I’m especially interested in enabling LLMs to adapt to local contexts by efficiently leveraging private data in decentralized, resource-constrained environments.

⚙️ I aim to build intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also **deployable in real-world edge scenarios**, particularly where **privacy and energy efficiency** are essential.
