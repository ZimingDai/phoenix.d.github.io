👋 Hi there! I'm **Ziming Dai (戴子明)**, a second-year Master's student in the College of Intelligence and Computing at **Tianjin University** 🇨🇳. I'm currently working under the guidance of Prof. **Xiaofei Wang** and Prof. **Chao Qiu**.

💡 My research focuses on **federated learning**, **edge intelligence**, and **large language model (LLM) personalization**. I'm especially interested in enabling LLMs to adapt to local environments — using private data efficiently, securely, and with low energy cost.

⚙️ I aim to build intelligent systems that are not only powerful but also **deployable in real-world edge scenarios**, especially where privacy and efficiency matter.
