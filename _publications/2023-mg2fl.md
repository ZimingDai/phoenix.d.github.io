In this paper, we propose **MG²FL**, a novel multi-granularity grouping-based federated learning framework designed for green edge computing systems. MG²FL addresses key challenges in traditional FL—such as high communication energy consumption, model heterogeneity, and vulnerability to malicious participants—by introducing three core innovations.

First, a **balanced graph partitioning** mechanism is employed to group edge devices with low communication overhead and strong inter-device guidance. Second, a **multi-granularity guidance model** allows large-scale, fine-granularity models to effectively guide smaller models, boosting overall learning performance. Third, a **credit-based model aggregation strategy** ensures that only trustworthy edge devices contribute significantly to the global model, enhancing robustness against adversarial behavior.

This work is a collaboration between **Tianjin University**, **Carleton University**, and the **Guangdong Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy (Shenzhen)**.
