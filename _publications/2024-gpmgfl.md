This work introduces **GP-MGFL**, a federated learning framework that leverages **balanced graph partitioning** to group clients based on capability similarity and applies **cross-granularity guidance** to improve local and inter-group model learning. Additionally, a **blockchain-based credit scoring system** is integrated to handle trust management and leader selection during the aggregation process.

GP-MGFL is designed to address the challenges of heterogeneity, trust, and communication efficiency in federated learning, especially in edge-cloud environments with diverse devices and unreliable participants.
